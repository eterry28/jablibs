# Mad Libs
**What is a Mad Libs**

According to Wikipedia, Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game, usually played at parties, where one player prompts other players for a list of words to substitute blanks in a story before reading out the completed story aloud. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs
 
Example:
 
We start with a story, containing several blanked out words. Hereâ€™s a basic example:
 
Rumble in the  _______.
 
We then prompt the user to fill in the gaps, in this case, with a noun or place. We might end up with something like this:

Rumble in the Toilet.
 
Obviously, the more entertaining the original story, the better the laughs will be at the end!
